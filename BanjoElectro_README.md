# BanjoElectro

**BanjoElectro** is a dark plucked-string synthesis repo focused on generating **ominous banjo-electric hybrid tones**, ritual-picked melodic loops, eerie harmonic phrases, and resample-ready one-shots for cinematic, dark folk, horror, trailer, game, and hybrid production.

It started as an attempt to build a haunted Obsidian-style banjo layer, then evolved toward a more **electric-string-adjacent** sound: less bright folk snap, more shadowed sustain, more upper-mid bite, and more usable tone for dark modern production.

---

## What it is

BanjoElectro is a lightweight Python-based synthesis toolkit that renders original plucked-string material to WAV using:

- plucked-string style synthesis
- dark harmonic shaping
- pickup-like upper-mid bite
- subtle saturation
- stereo ambience
- loop-oriented rendering
- tuned one-shot generation

This repo is for producers, sound designers, game audio builders, and experimental composers who want something that sits between:

- haunted banjo
- electric plucked string
- ritual folk texture
- dark hybrid scoring instrument

---

## Sound character

BanjoElectro is designed around a very specific tone target:

- **dark**
- **ominous**
- **hollow**
- **ritualistic**
- **electric-edged**
- **cinematic**
- **resample-friendly**

Instead of chasing a clean bluegrass banjo emulation, this project leans into a stylized instrument voice that feels more like:

> a banjo body haunted by an electric pickup in a cathedral at midnight

---

## Core goals

- Build a distinct plucked-string sound that does **not** feel generic
- Generate loops that are immediately useful in production
- Keep the synthesis lightweight and editable
- Make the system easy to expand into full packs
- Support dark melodic writing, not just isolated plucks
- Create a repo that can evolve into a fuller instrument and sample ecosystem

---

## Repository focus

BanjoElectro is meant to cover three main layers:

### 1. Synth engine
The Python synthesis code that creates the sound.

### 2. Rendered assets
Exported one-shots and loops generated from the synth.

### 3. Expansion pipeline
A structure for future packs, alternate tone families, presets, and batch rendering.

---

## Current content direction

The repo is built to support assets like:

- dark electric-banjo one-shots
- ominous arpeggiated loops
- harmonized tremolo phrases
- ritual pulse motifs
- eerie upper harmonic phrases
- slow cinematic triptych chords
- fast blackened picked motifs

Typical outputs include folders such as:

- `Loops/`
- `OneShots/`
- `Docs/`

---

## Technical approach

BanjoElectro uses a custom lightweight synthesis chain built around:

- plucked-string style excitation
- decaying resonant delay behavior
- controlled transient/pick shaping
- harmonic reinforcement
- darker filtered blend paths
- amp-like saturation
- stereo delay/reverb finishing
- seamless loop-edge smoothing

The goal is not to perfectly model a real acoustic instrument.

The goal is to produce a **high-quality stylized instrument voice** that sounds expensive, memorable, and dark.

---

## Why this repo exists

A lot of sample packs and synth presets in this lane fall into one of two problems:

### Problem 1: Too acoustic
They sound overly folk, bright, thin, or traditional.

### Problem 2: Too synthetic
They sound flat, plasticky, weak, or disconnected from any believable string behavior.

BanjoElectro exists to hit the middle ground:

- organic enough to feel like a struck/picked string
- synthetic enough to be shaped into a unique branded sound
- dark enough to matter in modern cinematic and hybrid production

---

## Use cases

BanjoElectro is suited for:

- horror scoring
- game audio
- dark fantasy music
- ritual ambient composition
- trailer music
- dark trap / hybrid beats
- industrial folk textures
- cinematic loop creation
- custom one-shot rendering
- resampling into samplers or plugins

It layers especially well with:

- drones
- choir pads
- dark bass
- sparse percussion
- cinematic impacts
- analog pulse textures
- distorted low strings

---

## Example tone lanes

BanjoElectro can be pushed toward several adjacent flavors:

- **Haunted Banjo** — more body, more hollow resonance
- **Electric String** — more pickup bite, longer sustain
- **Ritual Folk** — darker chord phrasing, sparse ambience
- **Blackened Harmonics** — thinner, eerie high-end phrases
- **Obsidian Pulse** — low plucked motifs meant to sit over bass and percussion
- **Cathedral Tremor** — slower layered plucks with ambient tail

## Design philosophy

BanjoElectro follows a few simple rules:

### Distinct voice over generic realism
The sound must feel like its own instrument identity.

### Production usefulness over novelty
If it sounds weird but does not sit in a track, it fails.

### Dark harmony first
This repo is built for mood and harmonic phrasing, not just isolated test tones.

### Lightweight synthesis
The system should stay easy to inspect, edit, and extend.

### Expansion-ready
Every pass should make future batch rendering, preset packs, and plugin conversion easier.

---

## What makes it different

BanjoElectro is not trying to be:

- a perfect acoustic banjo emulation
- a generic guitar preset library
- a one-button cinematic pad generator
- a random experimental noise box

It is trying to be something narrower and more memorable:

**a branded dark plucked-string sound system** with enough flexibility to move between banjo, electric string, and haunted hybrid territory.

---

## Output format

Typical renders are exported as:

- **48 kHz**
- **32-bit float WAV**
- loop-ready or one-shot-ready
- original synthesized audio

---

## Recommended production chains

BanjoElectro sounds especially good when followed by chains like:

### Dark cinematic chain
- gentle EQ
- tape or soft clip saturation
- long dark reverb
- subtle stereo widening above the low mids

### Ritual folk chain
- transient smoothing
- plate reverb
- short slap delay
- low shelf control

### Electric hybrid chain
- amp sim
- cabinet IR
- harmonic saturation
- dark chorus or microshift
- filtered feedback delay

---

## Planned roadmap

### Phase 1
- core synth voice
- one-shot rendering
- phrase loops
- README + repo structure

### Phase 2
- more electric-string variants
- palm-muted plucks
- lead sustain tones
- alternate body models
- multiple darkness/pickup presets

### Phase 3
- batch rendering by key and scale
- BPM-aware loop families
- preset pack builder
- multisample export set
- sampler mapping support

### Phase 4
- plugin prototype
- GUI instrument wrapper
- drag-and-render preset workflow
- stem and DI-style output modes

---

## Future expansions

Planned sound families include:

- **Obsidian Electric**
- **Cathedral Wire**
- **Ash Pulse**
- **Black Marrow**
- **Veilglass Harmonics**
- **Midnight Triptych**
- **Ritual Chug**
- **Ghost Lead**
- **Hollow Tremolo**
- **Gravewire Plucks**

---

## Who this is for

BanjoElectro is for people who hear an in-between sound in their head and never find it in normal sample packs.

If you want:

- darker than banjo
- stranger than guitar
- more musical than noise design
- more distinctive than stock plucks

this repo is built for that lane.

---

## Status

**Active sound-design repo.**  
The current focus is refining the core voice and building stronger rendered asset packs around it.

---

## Vision

BanjoElectro is not just a folder of sounds.

It is the start of a **custom dark plucked-string instrument ecosystem** that can eventually expand into:

- standalone sample packs
- batch render systems
- sampler-ready libraries
- plugin instruments
- cinematic hybrid production tools
